// The C++ compiler mangles C function names. extern "C" { /* your C functions */ } prevents this.
// You should wrap all C function prototypes declared in headers with ASDISPLAYNODE_EXTERN_C_BEGIN/END, even if
// they are included only from .m (Objective-C) files. It's common for .m files to start using C++
// features and become .mm (Objective-C++) files. Always wrapping the prototypes with
// AGK_EXTERN_C_BEGIN/END will save someone a headache once they need to do this. You do not need to
// wrap constants, only C functions. See StackOverflow for more details:
